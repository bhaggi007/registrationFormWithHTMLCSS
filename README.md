# registrationFormWithHTMLCSS

This project is for practising responsive web design course from freecodecamp.

In this project we will be working on creating a registration form using html and css, without using any library

Fixed issues
Find out why is the input text going out of form --> fixed by adjusting the margin and padding
size of select not same as input --> fixed
made the text boxes a little round --> fixed
Also did some style changes for button -> fixed
Next issues
radio buttons and Checkboxes not appearing on the same line it should appear on the same line --> fixed. I used width:unset property to resolve this
The radio buttons and check box should appear before the text and should come on the next line by default --> again this was resolved by width:unset property
Text area needs to be bigger --> done
work on submit button, looks ok... but not good... This needs to be a little smaller and centered: looks ok now

even the submit button now has same border radius as other input options. This needs to be fixed ---> fixed
